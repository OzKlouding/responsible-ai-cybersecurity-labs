## 📌 Overview
This repository is a **90-day hands-on lab portfolio** exploring the intersection of **Responsible AI (RAI), Cybersecurity, and Cloud Security Engineering**.  

The goal is to:  
- Build **secure-by-design AI systems**.  
- Explore **GenAI threats** (prompt injection, PII leakage).  
- Automate **compliance reporting** (GDPR, SOX, PCI, FAA).  
- Develop **incident response playbooks** for AI outages.  

This project demonstrates **cloud security, AI governance, and compliance automation skills** aligned with modern **Senior Security Engineer (Responsible AI)** roles.
